# RcPokedex

This application is designed to showcase my knowledge using Angular. All content used belongs to their respective owners. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## Description
In the RC-Pokedex application, users will be able to view Pokemon based on the original Kanto pokedex. The home page will show some random Pokemon that each user can click on to see further details. There is also a Pokemon List that the user can use to browse through even more Pokemon. When a user clicks on a Pokemon, they can see details like their original assigned ID in the Pokemon database, height, weight, and description. 
    
## Executive Summary 

- The RC-Pokedex application will list Pokemon information available from the PokeAPI
- All users will be able to view random Pokemon, view Pokemon according to the original list, and see details about each Pokemon

### Future Goals

- Store data retrieved from the API locally in order to reduce calls and increase performance for both the User and decrease resource use from the API
- Ensure the pagination lists the Pokemon numerically
- Be able to sort Pokemon according to ID and other details

### API:

https://pokeapi.co/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
